# VRSBUTBI

VRSBUTBI is a 3D VR construction simulator built on the Unity game engine. 

Its purpose is to provide novice construction operators with an introduction to their work setting and tasks, allowing operators to familiarize themselves with tools and operating procedures while removing the risks involved. 

Operating in a virtual environment will also allow for construction supervisors to observe and capture worker footage in real time for later evaluation.
