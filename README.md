# VRSBUTBI

VRSBUTBI is a 3D VR (virtual reality) construction simulator built on the Unity game
engine. Its purpose is to simplify the creation of virtual reality scenes for construction
simulations. This would allow VR to be more easily used for training and modeling construction
sites.

The development of a stand-alone construction simulation program was inspired by the
legacy Vita2D post-processing animator program (from 2007). VRSBUTBI aims to build upon
and expand many of the features offered by Vita2D, but in 3d space.

Like Vita2D, VRSBUTBI will allow the end user to create their own VR scene with user
defined objects and movement. The user will be able to do this without needing to be familiar
with a scene editor.

This project is to provide novice construction operators with an introduction to their work setting and tasks, allowing operators to familiarize themselves with tools and operating procedures while removing the physical, financial, and legal risks involved. This will help to reduce any industrial accidents and to learn how to prevent any accidents.

Operating in a virtual environment will also allow for construction supervisors to observe and capture worker footage in real time for later evaluation.
